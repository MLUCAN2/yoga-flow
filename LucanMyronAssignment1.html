            <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
            <p>
                Yoga directly translates from sanskrit as "yoke." What this word means is to unite. This union is the joining of one's self with the universe
                or with nature. Yoga is the grounding of ones self through meditation and often movement. This is done in a myriad of ways and will often look very
                different in each person's practice. There isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to do yoga but what we aim to do as you go through this site is to inform
                and expand your knowledge of the practice so that you can connect with yourself and with the world around you. We will begin with breathing and its importance
                to movement and connection.
