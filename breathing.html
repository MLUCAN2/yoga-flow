            <h2>Breathing</h2>
            <p>
                Breathing is an unconscious function that is part of the autonomic nervous system, similar to heart rate, perspiration, digestion, and much more. However,
                we have the unique ability to also breath consciously, which in turn can calm us, warm us, and ultimately align us. This breathing is known in sanskrit as 
                Pranayama. More specifically, we use breath through our yoga practice to consciously move from posture to posture. When we can flow from breath to movement 
                we are being intentional. This intention is what guides us through our life. As odd as it may sound, breathing is one of the hardest things to master in yoga. 
                However, even being a novice at it has its rewards. You feel much more accomplished, grounded, and stable not just in your practice but in life.
