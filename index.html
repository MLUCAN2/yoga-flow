            <h2>What is Yoga?</h2>
            <p>
                Yoga directly translates from sanskrit as "yoke." What this word means is to unite. This union is the joining of one's self with the universe
                or with nature. Yoga is the grounding of ones self through meditation and often movement. This is done in a myriad of ways and will often look very
                different in each person's practice. There isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to do yoga but what we aim to do as you go through this site is to inform
                and expand your knowledge of the practice so that you can connect with yourself and with the world around you. We will begin with breathing and its importance
                to movement and connection.

            <h2>Breathing</h2>
            <p>
                Breathing is an unconscious function that is part of the autonomic nervous system, similar to heart rate, perspiration, digestion, and much more. However,
                we have the unique ability to also breath consciously, which in turn can calm us, warm us, and ultimately align us. This breathing is known in sanskrit as 
                Pranayama. More specifically, we use breath through our yoga practice to consciously move from posture to posture. When we can flow from breath to movement 
                we are being intentional. This intention is what guides us through our life. As odd as it may sound, breathing is one of the hardest things to master in yoga. 
                However, even being a novice at it has its rewards. You feel much more accomplished, grounded, and stable not just in your practice but in life.

            <h2>Postures</h2>
            <p>
                In yoga there are a wide variety of postures, many with a story behind them. As the site becomes more built up, we will add more to the list. For now we will
                focus on some of the more well known blueprint postures. These postures are foundational for learning others throughout your practice so begin to familiarize
                yourself with them.

                        Chakras, or disks in sanskrit are believed to be energy points throughout our body. There are over 100 but we will focus on the seven major chakras in ascending order
                        root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, and crown. The purpose of yoga when it comes to chakras is to create balance with each one. 
                        As the site grows so will the information.
